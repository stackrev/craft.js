Development for Craft.js began in April 2019 as a personal project of mine. It was months after months of experimenting and trial-and-error until it was able to become a viable solution. The repository was made public and the first public beta release was made in January 2020! Since then, the project has gained traction and contributions from people all over the world.

Craft.js is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/prevwong/craft.js/blob/master/LICENSE) and is built with 100% love.
