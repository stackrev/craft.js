A huge thank you to the authors and contributors of these following libraries/frameworks:

- **react-dnd** The React drag-n-drop library. 
Although it is not actually used here - many aspects of Craft.js is written with react-dnd as a reference along with some utilities and functions being borrowed. 
- **Grape.js** The HTML web builder framework. This has served as an inspiration for Craft.js. The element positioning logic used in Craft.js is borrowed from Grape.js
- **use-methods** A super handy hook when dealing with reducers. Craft.js uses a modified version of use-methods that works with Redux instead of `useReducer`
