A huge thank you to the authors and contributors of the following libraries/frameworks:

- **[react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd)** The React drag-n-drop library. 
Although it is not actually used here, many aspects of Craft.js are written with react-dnd as a reference along with some utilities and functions being borrowed. 
- **[Grape.js](https://github.com/artf/grapesjs)** The HTML web builder framework. This has served as an inspiration for Craft.js. The element positioning logic used in Craft.js is borrowed from Grape.js
- **[use-methods](https://github.com/pelotom/use-methods)** A super handy hook when dealing with reducers. Craft.js uses a slightly modified version of `use-methods` to better fit our API.
