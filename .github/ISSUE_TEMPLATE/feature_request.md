**Is your feature request related to the core ?**

Remember that Craft.js is an abstraction; implementation-related features are not part of the core.

"Implement API to handle drag preview", "Add editor action to copy elements", "Show drag preview when dragging elements" are examples of feature requests that are related to the core.

"Implement a file uploader", "Add a gallery component", "Add a layers panel", "Create tooltip component" are examples of feature requests that are **not** related to the core. We could still consider working on some of them as separate packages (eg: [@craftjs/layers](https://github.com/prevwong/craft.js/tree/master/packages/layers)). However, please understand that these will not be top priority at the moment.
